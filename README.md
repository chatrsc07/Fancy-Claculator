# Fancy Calculator
This is a joke project.
## IT IS NOT GOOD ON PURPOSE
The fancy calculator is a joke between python devs. 

I'm not that good at python. 

I want to make a calculator in python but in  the worst most inefficient way possible. 

### Functionality
Addition with positive and negative integers

Subtraction with positive interviewers

Multiplication with positive integers

Wraps around when numbers exceed 9999 to -9999

All arithmetic is done through addition

Also, the variables are named after Shrek the movie because pep8 is annoying

### Future things
Division - I don't know how this will work tho

Graphing?
